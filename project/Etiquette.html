            <h2>Golf Etiquette</h2>
            <p>Golf is a game of respect, courtesy, and tradition. Following proper etiquette ensures an enjoyable
                experience for everyone on the course. Here are some key rules and tips to follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be Quiet and Still:</strong>
                    When someone is taking their shot, avoid talking, moving, or making noise. Respect their
                    concentration and focus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repair Divots and Ball Marks:</strong>
                    Always repair any divots you make on the fairway and ball marks on the green. Use a divot repair
                    tool or tee to fix the damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep Pace with the Group Ahead:</strong>
                    Play at a reasonable pace to avoid holding up groups behind you. If you're slower, allow faster
                    groups to play through.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stay Safe:</strong>
                    Always ensure the area is clear before taking your shot. Yell "Fore!" if your ball is heading toward
                    another player.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Respect the Course:</strong>
                    Avoid driving carts on greens or tee boxes, and follow cart path rules. Keep the course in good
                    condition for others.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be Ready to Play:</strong>
                    Prepare for your shot while others are playing. This helps maintain the pace of play and keeps the
                    game moving smoothly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Limit Practice Swings:</strong>
                    Take only one or two practice swings to avoid slowing down the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Keep Your Temper in Check:</strong>
                    Golf can be frustrating, but avoid throwing clubs or shouting. Stay calm and enjoy the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Follow Dress Codes:</strong>
                    Many courses have dress codes. Wear appropriate golf attire, such as collared shirts and golf shoes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Respect Other Players:</strong>
                    Congratulate others on good shots and remain positive. Golf is a social game, and good sportsmanship
                    is essential.

                    <strong>Mark Your Ball:</strong>
                    Use a marker to identify your ball on the green to avoid confusion with other players' balls.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stand in the Right Place:</strong>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leave the Course as You Found It:</strong>
                    Rake bunkers after hitting out of them and replace divots on the fairway.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Turn Off Your Phone:</strong>
                    Keep your phone on silent mode to avoid disturbing others during the game.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Be Mindful of Time:</strong>
                    Arrive early for your tee time and avoid unnecessary delays during the round.
