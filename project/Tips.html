            <h2>Beginner Tips</h2>
            <p>Getting started with golf can be overwhelming. Here are some detailed tips to help you begin and improve:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Start with Basic Equipment:</strong>
                    You don’t need to buy expensive clubs right away. Start with a beginner set of clubs that includes a
                    driver, a few irons, a wedge, and a putter. Borrowing or renting clubs is also a great option when
                    starting out.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Practice Your Swing:</strong>
                    Spend time at a driving range to practice your swing. Focus on consistency rather than power. A
                    smooth, controlled swing will yield better results than trying to hit the ball as hard as possible.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Learn the Rules and Scoring System:</strong>
                    Familiarize yourself with the basic rules of golf and how scoring works. Understanding concepts like
                    par, birdie, bogey, and penalty strokes will make your experience more enjoyable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Take Lessons:</strong>
                    Consider taking lessons from a golf instructor. A professional can help you develop proper
                    techniques and avoid bad habits that are hard to correct later.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Focus on Short Game:</strong>
                    Putting and chipping are critical parts of the game. Spend time practicing on the putting green and
                    learning how to control your short shots around the green.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Play with Experienced Golfers:</strong>
                    Join a group of experienced golfers who can guide you and offer tips during your rounds. Observing
                    their techniques and etiquette can be incredibly valuable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Stay Patient and Have Fun:</strong>
                    Golf is a challenging sport that takes time to master. Don’t get discouraged by bad shots or high
                    scores. Focus on enjoying the process and celebrating small improvements.

            <h2>Additional Tips to Improve Your Game</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Warm Up Before Playing:</strong>
                    Spend 10–15 minutes stretching and hitting a few practice shots before starting your round. This
                    will help you loosen up and avoid injuries.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Track Your Progress:</strong>
                    Keep a record of your scores and identify areas where you need improvement. For example, if you
                    struggle with putting, dedicate more practice time to it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Understand Course Management:</strong>
                    Learn how to plan your shots based on the layout of the course. Avoid risky shots and focus on
                    playing strategically to lower your score.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Invest in Comfortable Gear:</strong>
                    Wear comfortable golf shoes and clothing that allow you to move freely. Proper gear can make a big
                    difference in your performance and enjoyment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Watch Golf Tutorials:</strong>
                    There are countless online tutorials and videos that can help you learn new techniques and
                    strategies. Watching professional golfers can also inspire you to improve.
